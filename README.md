    <h1>Response Headers Values Checker</h1>
</div>

## What is this?
This is a Chrome Extension. It's a very simple one: the extension just will read the Response of the current page and will show,
inside the extension popup, the value you will write into the input.

For example: if you write "date" inside the input, inside the "Result" section you will see the value of "date"
readed from the header response.

All the values you need must be separated by comma.
In order to make the extension works correctly, refresh the page before read the values.
